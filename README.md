Get the season times of different Montana ski resorts and also where they are located in respect to the user.

The reason that we are creating this Web Application is because we are tired of having to search through countless different ski resort websites trying to find all the different information that we want to know. Many Ski resort Web sites are poorly designed and it is oftentimes difficult to find need to know things such as when they open the mountain up for ski season or their mountain biking season. We created this App to solve this by using Pythons built in requests and beautifulsoup.

Python's requests grabs the html element from the targest site, in this case the ski resort websites, and then we use beautifulsoup to parse out the specific information that we need to let our users know a few very important things. Our main focus is letting our users know when the Mountain is open and second, any holidays that might make the mountain closed. Our other main focus is giving the users locations and directions to get to the mountain from their specified zip code that they put in when creating a user account. This is done using a combination of Google services (Maps JavaScript API, Distance matrix API, Place autocomplete API).

With this application we hope that anybody that is planning on visiting mountains will have an easier time planning their vacation/trip by using our app that saves them the trouble of having to search through a badly made site and instead has all the information in one single easy to use spot. We are starting of this app with just Montana specific Ski resorts but we plan on making the App infinitely updateable with many different ski resorts from across the world, in the future.
